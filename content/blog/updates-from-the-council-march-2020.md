Hello, friends!

It’s hard to believe we’re already two months into this city council session. I’ve worked hard to hit the ground running and am proud of the resolutions I have presented and votes taken—I'm working hard to represent you. Below you’ll find highlights of some important issues so far and ways for residents to take action to support ongoing work. I hope to provide more regular updates going forward, but if you have any questions about meetings or upcoming agendas, please don’t hesitate to reach out at nmorell@medford-ma.gov.

**Short Term Rentals**

In meeting before this legislative session, Councillor Bears and I identified regulation of short term rentals as a common priority. We introduced a resolution in January to request that the city solicitor provide framework of a draft ordinance using the authority granted to municipalities pursuant to Chapter 337 of the 2018 Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts. Medford already voted to impose a community impact fee, so this ordinance is more targeted at the safety aspect of these rentals including but not limited to: creating a local registry, mandating safety practices regarding individual room rentals, and minimizing neighborhood impacts by posting noise and other relevant ordinances that renters much abide by. The council voted in favor of the creation of this framework, and future meetings are anticipated to work out the proposed ordinance.  

**Senior Tax Deferral** 

This is a state program that Medford takes part in that allows residents who meet certain criteria and are over the age of 65 to defer their property taxes until their house is sold or they pass away. Municipalities have the ability to set an income cap and an interest rate for this program. Medford’s current cap of $40,000 lags behind our neighbors and limits who can take part in this program. In January, I introduced a resolution to raise this cap to the senior circuit breaker tax (the maximum amount allowed by the state which in 2019 ranged from 60k to 90k depending on filing). I further recommended we adjust the language around our cap to note that the program is open to,  “seniors with income not exceeding the state cap calculated under clause 41a of section 5 of chapter 59” so that as this state cap raises, so does our income cap. The council voted in favor of moving this to a future committee of the whole to examine the financial feasibility of this change. 

**Styrofoam** 

This week, CCSR students Ellie Hunt and Juliette Franks presented signatures from their petition in favor of banning styrofoam (the commonly used name for polystyrene) in Medford. The duo made an excellent presentation explaining why this ban is so important and how it can move Medford forward in lowering our ecological footprint. Ahead of the meeting, Councillor Bears and I worked on draft legislation for the ban, taking into consideration the time needed to transition to alternatives. The council voted unanimously in favor of moving the proposed resolution to an upcoming committee of the whole to edit and finalize. Several residents came out in support of the ban as well. (Thank you!)



**CPA Funding**

Fifteen impressive projects recommended by the Community Preservation Committee came before the council for a vote to appropriate funding. All projects received unanimous votes in favor and the council also voted in favor of transferring $250,000 from the CPA General Reserve into the CPA Community Housing Reserve.



## **Action Items**

**Safe Routes to School**

The Safe Routes to School project near the Brooks School is in its final steps. The Engineering Department is working with abutters for any necessary takings and encroachment agreements. Once these are finalized, the new right of way and takings will be voted on by the council—hopefully in April or early May. Learn more about the project and reach out to the council with your thoughts. 



**Community Development Block Grant Public Meeting**

The City of Medford will host a public meeting on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 at 5:00 pm at City Hall, Room 201, Medford, MA 02155. The goal of the meeting is to gain input from low and moderate income residents, social service agencies, and the general public in development of the city’s Five Year Consolidated Plan 2020-2024 and Annual Action Plan for the 2020-2021 Program Year. CDBG funding can be used in a number of ways a long as they fall under the umbrella of “benefiting low and moderate income persons, prevention, or elimination of slums or blight, or to address community development.”

**Events**

Join me on Friday, March 6 at the West Medford Community Center for this month's Words and Music to celebrate the passage of the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing the Women of America equal "Suffrage." Historian Dee Morris and State Senator Pat Jehlen will be filling out the panel.
